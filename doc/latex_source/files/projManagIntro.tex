\section{Intention}
This part covers the project and quality management of WinLFS. It is used to keep track of the nominal and actual time used for a task. Tasks are defined in the project plan in chapter \ref{cha:projectPlan} and nominal time estimation for this task can be found in the time variance comparison in chapter \ref{cha:timeVarianceComparison}.

Additionally, in this part, personal reports and other personal statements can be found.

\section{Process Model}
At the beginning of this project, we planned to strictly use a prototype driven process model. The problem with this model was, we had no idea what a prototype for this project would look like. Therefore, we renamed the prototypes and called them phases. Our project is now split into different phases which we could determine and plan easier.
