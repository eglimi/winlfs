\section{Overview}
This documentation does not provide information about the read functionality of the driver. Also the basic concepts of a file system driver and general descriptions are not included. This information have already been given in the documentation of the continuing studies diploma thesis \cite{Ext2fuerXP}.

\subsection{General Data flow}
Whenever a user mode application or a kernel mode application requests an operation from a file system driver (FSD), the I/O Manager allocates an IRP (I/O request packet) and calls the FSD with this IRP. The FSD accesses its I/O stack location in the IRP to determine what operation (indicated by the \verb~IRP_MJ_XXX~ function code) it should carry out on the target device. The target device is represented by the device object in its designated I/O stack location and is passed with the IRP to the driver. 

\subsection{Create a new file}
An IRP\_MJ\_CREATE is sent to the FSD whenever a new file or directory is created, or when a an existing file, device, directory, or volume is being opened. Normally this IRP is sent when an application has called \verb~CreateFile()~. An IRP\_MJ\_WRITE is sent to the FSD, for example, when an application has called \verb~WriteFile()~.

\noindent
This means, whenever the FSD receives a IRP\_MJ\_CREATE, it tests if a new file needs to be created. If so, preliminary tests (file or directory name validity, flags, etc.) are made and a new Inode is created. Figure \ref{fig:ext2FsdCreate} illustrates this procedure of receiving an IRP\_MJ\_CREATE request and figure \ref{fig:ext2FsdNewFile} illustrates the process of creating a new inode in detail. The two diagrams do not describe function in detail. They only give a general overview of the basic data flow.

Every function in the above two diagrams are subject to describe in more detail. This has been done in the code documentation in part \ref{par:implementation}. For even more details please consult the code.
